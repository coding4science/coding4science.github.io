# Goal of this project

Nowadays, computer skills are required in almost any academic field (beyond) although most academics do not come with a strong background in computer science.
The goal of this website is thus to provide useful tips for scientists (PhD students notably) in their use of modern computer tools such as version control, containers for reproducible science, packaging, ...

It does not aim to provide full tutorials for learning a programing language (as lot of resources/formations) nor step-by-step procedures to e.g. connect to your particular institutional computations server (as there should be local informational resources to your institution particular setup). On the contrary it seeks to give an broad overview of a set of tools that are becoming more and more present in day-to-day research. 

This website is hosted using Github Pages and is open to contributions. Collaborating on its content can thus be seen as a way to enter the world of versioning and open source (without the added technicality of writing some software code).
