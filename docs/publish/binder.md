# Facilitate the discovery of your code

A very good way to ensure that your method and library will be used by others is to provide simple and easy ways for potential users to test your code.

## Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook can be a good way of providing a small example/demo of your library/package, particularly when combined with Binder (cf below).

## Binder

Binderhub is a web application that allows you to provide a link that allows any web user to access to an online sandbox where they can play with your code and examples without installing anything.

[https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/) is a free and open instance of binderhub.

**Use mybinder**:

- Put your code (demo/tuto, course...) on a github repo online
- Generate a link on https://mybinder.org/ from your repo link
- When going to this new url, any webuser get a sandbox containing your code and with all wanted packages already installed.
