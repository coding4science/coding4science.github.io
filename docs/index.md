# Goal of this project

The goal of this website is to provide useful tips for scientists (PhD students notably) in their use of modern computer tools such as version control, containers for reproducible science, packaging, ...

It does not aim to provide full tutorial for learning a programing language or . It seeks to give an overview of a set of tools that are becoming more and more 



This website is hosted using Github Pages and is open to contributions. Collaborating on its content can thus be seen as a way to enter the world of versioning and open source (without the added technicality of writing some software code).
